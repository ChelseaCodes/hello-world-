# hello-world-
learning how to set up a repository in github 
I have only learned how to, kind of, use TFS from Visual Studio
I want to have an easy way to send code to my dad - lol so i'm using Git
from what i understand:
Master: your main code
Branches: code to merge with Master once refining whatever tests/changes/features are made and working
Commit: is similar to "check-in" for TFS
